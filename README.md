# UDD Master Data Science Capstone Project

This is the Capstone Project I submitted as part of my Master´s degree in __Data Science__ to __"Universidad del Desarrollo"__


## Implement a RL and IRL agents to play "Punch-Out!" King Hippo level, and __prove__ that it can only beat the level or score higher points constantly after receiving "expert demonstrations" on how to do it.

This repo is divided in mainly two parts:

* A Jupyter Notebook section, where we´ll explore the necessary libraries and possible changes needed to implement the project.
* A source files sections that will take the ideas of the Jupyter Notebook section and expand them to create source files that allow us to deploy the agents and train them using simple commands.

The parts will be uploaded as I finish translating them to English.
